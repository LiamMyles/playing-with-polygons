          <h2>How to use</h2>
          <p>
            You can make all sorts of polygon shaped art, and you're going to
            need to explore all the options to see everything. But here is a few
            examples to start you off{" "}
            <span role="img" aria-label="smiley face">
              üòÅ
            </span>
          </p>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <img alt="polygon with drawing background" />
          <p>
            You can edit the background to not redraw and you will create an
            animated painting effect.
          </p>
          <img alt="polygon with fading background" />
          <p>
            By default the background will redraw with an opacity, so you will
            see a trailing image as the polygon plays
          </p>
          <h3>Polygon Animation</h3>
          <p>Polygons can move in 2 main ways. Rotation, and scaling</p>
          <img alt="Rotating Polygon" />
          <p>
            Rotating polygons... will... rotate{" "}
            <span role="img" aria-label="Sweating Smiley face">
              üòÖ
            </span>
          </p>
          <img alt="Scaling Polygon" />
          <p>Scaling polygons will actually just bounce between two sizes.</p>
          <h3>Making GIF's and Jif's</h3>
          <p>
            You can make a gif by pressing the make gif button, which you can
            then download!
          </p>
          <p>
            The longer your gif the longer it will take to process, and if your
            device isn't powerful it can take a while to generate the gif.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you do actually make any gif's I would love to see them,
            so be sure to tweet them @PlayingPolygons
          </p>
