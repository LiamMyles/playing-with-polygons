        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some basic tips that I hope will help you make something cool{" "}
          <span role="img" aria-label="smiley face">

        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          By default the background will redraw with an opacity, this will cause
          a trailing image when the polygons move. Adjusting the opacity will
          change how much <em>trail/blur</em> is left behind.
        </p>
        <img alt="polygon with fading background" src={fadedBackgroundLogo} />
        <p>
          The <em>redraw background</em> <strong>Edit Background</strong> option
          will cause the polygon to paint. This creates the most interesting
          patterns when its left to run for a while.
        </p>
        <img alt="polygon with drawing background" src={redrawBackgroundLogo} />
        <h3>Polygon Animation</h3>
        <p>
          Polygons move in two main ways. <strong>Rotation</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Scaling</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rotation</strong> can be either clockwise or anti-clockwise.
          But you will find the most interesting changes when you adjust its
          speed.
        </p>
        <img alt="Rotating Polygon" src={rotatingPolygon} />
        <p>
          <strong>Scaling</strong> like the rotation is an endless cycle. And
          causes the polygon to scale between a maximum and a minimum size.
        </p>
        <img alt="Scaling Polygon" src={scalingPolygon} />
        <p>
          For the most interesting results you can combine scaling and rotation
          together.
        </p>
        <img
          alt="Rotating and Scaling Polygon"
          src={rotatingAndScalingPolygon}
        />
        <h3>Making GIF's or Jif's</h3>
        <p>
          You can make and download a gif by pressing the{" "}
          <strong>Make Gif</strong> button. Just be aware that the longer the
          gif is, the longer it will take to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're on a phone I would recommend creating short gifs. But you
          can make them 10 seconds long if you don't mind the wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do make anything you want to share on twitter, be sure to
          include <em>@PlayingPolygons</em> to share with the{" "}
          <a href="#">Playing With Polygons Twitter</a>
