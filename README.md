Welcome to Playing with Polygons! An idea that has its roots in 2014 with a bug in a university project.

Between University and now I have become a Web Developer. Then in 2020 - during the Covid-19 lockdown - I finally created a little app that takes that bug to its logical extreme.

## About this Project

This project is in the simplest terms an app that lets you create polygon themed art. As well as allowing you to generate gif's of said art.

Here are some examples of what I have made with it so far:

## Tech Used

So the core of the project is React written in typescript. With jest & react-testing-library being used for the testing.

Context and Reducers are used heavily to deal with the state of the app.

And p5 is the canvas library that is used to draw the polygons.
