Welcome to Playing with Polygons! An idea that has its roots in 2014 with a bug in a university project.

Between University and now I have become a Web Developer. Then in 2020 - during the Covid-19 lockdown - I finally created a little app that takes that bug to its logical extreme.

## About this Project

This project is in the simplest terms is an app that lets you create polygon themed art. As well as allowing you to generate gif's of said art.

Here are some examples of what I have made with it so far:

![complex example](./src/images/too-many-polygons.gif)

## How to Play with Polygons

The app is hosted on [this repos Git hub pages page](https://liammyles.github.io/playing-with-polygons/). just visit the link and away you go.

## Tech Used

So the core of the project is React written in typescript. With jest & react-testing-library being used for the testing.

Context and Reducers are used heavily to deal with the state of the app.

And p5 is the canvas library that is used to draw the polygons.

## Starting the Project for yourself

If you want to fork, or clone this project here is some basic things you need to do to get things up and running.

### Setup

Setup is super basic, just run `yarn` to install the packages. 

### Development

You can run the development environment with `yarn dev` which will start up the create react app development environment. 

### Testing

To test the project just run `yarn test` which will start the jest test suite.
